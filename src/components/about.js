                    <p>Multiphase reactors are found in many diverse applications such as the manufacture of petroleum-based fuels, commodity and speciality chemicals,
                        pharmaceuticals, and the production of polymers. The understanding of complex fluid dynamic behaviours in the multiphase reactors has been studied through
                        computational flow modelling. This workshop provides state-of-the-art modelling methods for various multiphase reactors in terms of fundamental as well as
                        applications such as petroleum, chemical, biological and thermal processes and mineral processing</p>
